        <p>Finally, we come to the conflict between the two characters that do not exactly fit the definition of man: Macbeth and Macduff. The former is an interesting case, continually making assertions about the behaviours of a man but not following these behaviours. Macbeth is also unkillable by common men, as the witches' prophecy suggests. Macduff, on the other hand, has an entirely different definition of man than the rest of society, and was not of woman born, one of the play's defining assertions about what it means to be a man. Therefore both can be said to be more, or perhaps less, than the play's true definition of men.</p>
        <p>And yet their the result of their conflict is Macduff beheading Macbeth and bringing it to his king. If we bring this in conjunction with the apparitions warning, then is it safe to say that Macbeth was not much greater than a man, and therefore Macduff easily defeats him because the power of man is but nothing? Man can be powerful and ruthless, but in the end they are all mortal. Is Macbeth's great weakness the inability to percieve something other than what he interprets the society's definitions of a man to be? Even before death, Macbeth maintains the belief that a man should have courage and no fear, telling Macduff that his news has made him less of a man. This stubborness, then, could possibily be what brings the downfall of Macbeth.</p>
