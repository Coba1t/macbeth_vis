        <p class="quote">-- Lady Macbeth(1.7.49)</p><hr/>
         <p>Lady Macbeth's definition, however, is much more specific and violent than Macbeth's simple "man dares". She first talks about being a man as early as Act 1 Scene 7. When Macbeth begins to show signs of doubt, and talks about how Duncan is a good king, she berates him for not being a man. Lady Macbeth tells him that once he has set on a path to become king, he should not turn back. If he completes the deed, she says, then he will be much more than a man. She also rages about how the heavens were unfair to make her a woman, for in heart she seems even manlier than Macbeth.</p>
        <p>For Lady Macbeth, being a man is straightforward. A man does not turn back when he has already decided that he will walk forth, and a man will do anything to achieve his goals. Yet Lady Macbeth is, obviously, not naturally a man herself, so her ideas provide an outside perspective of the social ideals of a man. Her definitions of a man must therefore match what is expected of a man in Macbeth's time, and shows us the traits that were most valued among men in that period.</p>
