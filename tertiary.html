        <p class="quote">-- Macbeth(3.4.98)</p><hr/>
        <p>To fully understand Macbeth's situation and the events that led to Macbeth's tyranny, we ourselves must delve into the definitions of manhood that the play provides through its characters. First, we come to Macbeth's initial understanding of a man.</p>
        <p>Macbeth's first literal definition comes when he catches sight of the ghost of Banquo. He then shouts to the ghost that he is as brave as any man, but commands the ghost to take on a shape other than that of Banquo's. He reasons that the ghosts presence makes his tremble with fear, thus making him less of a man. When the ghost retreats, he says that he has become a man again. Therefore we can summarize that Macbeth believes that men should have no fear of their enemies.</p>
