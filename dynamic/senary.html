	<p class="quote">-- Second Apparition(4.1.79)</p><hr/>
	<p>Men, of course, are mortal. And that plays a huge role in how we all percieve the characteristics of men. Being mortal, a man's power is limited. Being mortal, a man's courage is limited. Being mortal, a man's greatness is limited. Indeed, death is a limit to everything mortal and therefore anything related to man. This is a theme in many plays, even Antigone: after Creon orders the sentry to find out who buried Eurynices, the chorus exclaims: "Only Death, from Death alone he will find no rescue but from desperate plagues he has plotted his escapes."</p>
	<p>Yet death is not the only characteristic of mortality. In <i>Macbeth</i>, a key theme of mortality is the state of being "of woman born." For mortals are all born from mortals, and Macbeth is no such exception. And being mortal, he is subject to the lusts and ambitions that mortals have. But there is an exception, of course. Macduff is <i>not</i> of woman born, which makes him less or greater than a man. This also explains his deviation from standard definitions of man, as is discussed on the next page.</p>
	<p>Despite guaranteeing Macbeth invinicibility, however, the apparition's prophecy also seems to be some kind of warning. "Laugh to scorn the power of man" implies that although men might seem great and powerful, their power is an illusion that is bound by their mortality."</p>
