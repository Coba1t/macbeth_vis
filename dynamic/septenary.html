	<h2>The Sorrow of Men</h2>
</div>
<div class="content">
	<div class="quoted"> I shall do so;<br/>But I must also feel it as a man:<br/>I cannot but remember such things were,<br/>That were most precious to me.</div>
	<p class="quote">-- Macduff(4.3.221)</p><hr/>
	<p>The images of man that we have previously described are mostly uniform. Men are ruthless, cruel, powerful, unaffected by immorality, and according to Lady Macbeth, strong when women are weak. Yet Macduff paints an entirely different picture of a man. After hearing the dreadful news from Ross, Macduff begins to mourn for his wife and children. Malcolm tells him to "dispute it like a man", reinforcing the previous image of the vengeful, ruthless man, but Macduff replies that he will feel like like a man.</p>
	<p>This brings an entirely new perspective on the play's definition of manhood. For Macduff, men can be emotional beings capable of feeling grief and sadness, unlike Macbeth and Lady Macbeth's initial portrayal of a real man. Macduff then converts this sorrow into rage and vengeance, but the sorrow exists long enough for him to feel it <i>like a man.</i> Despite Macduff's society's attempts to define what a man should be like, Macduff clearly believes in his own definition of manhood: a being capable of emotion as well as strength, and that these two concepts are not neccessarily contradictory. </p>
	<p>Not only does his belief contrast with that of Lady Macbeth's and Macbeth's, it also apparently contrasts with Malcolm's. Like Macbeth, Malcolm believes that a true man should feel no grief and no fear, but only anger and vengeance. This again proves that the values and definitions of society can have a great impact on people's own values and definitions.</p>
