        <p class="quote">-- Macbeth(3.1.91)</p><hr/>
        <p>As Macbeth says quite early in the play, there are many different types of men. When he reprimands the murderers for replying that they are men, he tells them that even dogs have varying kinds, that there are fast dogs, clever dogs, and hunting dogs. Perhaps the play, instead of saying that Macbeth's version of manhood is true, or Macduff's version is true, is instead saying that there are many kinds of men, and there might not be a way to summarize what all of them have in common.</p>
        <p>Men like Macbeth may be fearless and ruthless, while men like Macduff may be courageous but emotional. Not one definition is true, but one definition is true to each man, depending on who he is. Macbeth's atrocious behaviours, then, cannot be completely blamed on society forcing his definition of man to be the kind of man that kills Duncan, Banquo, and Macduff's family. No, Macbeth decides his own definition of a man, just as Macduff and other characters in the play have done. Yes, this definition is of course shaped by society, the witches, and Lady Macbeth, but he has the most say in what determines the exact definition that he chooses to follow. Therefore his actions are instead caused by Macbeth deluding himself and seeing himself as the kind of man that will kill Duncan, and eventually leading him to do the action himself.</p>
