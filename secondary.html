        <p class="quote">-- Macbeth(1.7.46)</p><hr/>
        <p>The society that Macbeth finds himself in is a very potent component in the reasonings behind his killing Duncan. Right from the beginning, three witches who have a questionable amount of power tell Macbeth that he will be King. By itself, this does nothing: It takes Macbeth's ponderings, with some help from Lady Macbeth, before he goes and kills Duncan in order to fulfil the witch's suggestions.</p>
        <p>Lady Macbeth is the one who convinces him, in the end, to go stab Duncan in his sleep. One of the primary ways she goes about this is putting a question mark his manhood, on the basis that a man takes action, on the battlefield just like when he has ambitions to fulfil. Macbeth's society, Lady Macbeth primarily, still never directly defines manhood, however. Macbeth interprets what he hears into his own definition of manhood. It is Macbeth's own interpretation of manhood, based on what society is providing him, interacting with what he wants (he may be indecisive, but he does have wants) that results in his conclusion that killing Duncan is the right decision.
        <p>So while society is a very potent component in Macbeth's reasons for taking the actions that he does, it is Macbeth's interpretation of that society that causes him to kill Duncan. He is also, however, able to interpret society's definition of morals, as we clearly see when he is lamenting over how Neptunes Oceans can't wash the blood from his hands. It was in the end then his decision to put his interpretation of manhood and the Kingship that comes with it above his interpretation of morals. But with the situation he found himself in at the time, how much blame should fall solely on his shoulders?</p>
