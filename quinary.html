        <p class="quote">-- Macbeth(2.2.57)</p><hr/>
        <p>Bloodstains are an important part of <i>Macbeth</i>. Both Macbeth and Lady Macbeth talk about the stain of blood on their hands: Macbeth starts to lament how the even the seas will never wash away the blood on his hands after killing Duncan, and Lady Macbeth begins to try and wipe off the blood on her hands after she has gotten ill. One might even say that the blood and stain of it are a major parts of being a man.</p>
        <p>After seeing Banquo's ghost, Macbeth begins the plot the murder of Macduff, and remarks that " I am in blood Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more, Returning were as tedious as go o'er". This also ties in with the societal values discussed previously; a soldier does not hesitate to kill, and he should not feel any remorse. If we assume that men are naturally soldiers, then a lack of remorse and ruthlessness to achieve one's goal must be a key attribute of being a man, at least according to Macbeth's society.</p>
        <p>But what do bloodstains have to do with being a man, and if Macbeth truly believes himself to be a man, why is he affected by them? The stain of blood symbolizes the guilt after commiting crimes such as the killing of both kings and innocent children, as Macbeth has done. If we suppose that the previous 'soldier' definition of man is true, then Macbeth is no true man, for he is deeply affected by his killing of Duncan. Yet as the story progresses, he becomes less and less susceptible to this guilt, possibly making him more of a man.</p>
